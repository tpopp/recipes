# Items I Would Buy Again

- Wine storage: vacuvin. I don't believe too much in the aeration related tools, especially because I tend to let my wine sit for a while after pouring anyway, but limiting the oxidation of wine definitely helps it last longer.
- Champagne storage: https://www.amazon.com/Cilio-Stainless-Steel-Champagne-Sealer/dp/B002797DJ8/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=champagne+stopper&qid=1565897141&s=gateway&sr=8-13 . Not having a handle that needs to be turned is nice. A turning component with these "cheap" tops tend to be very stiff and be annoying and require two hands.
