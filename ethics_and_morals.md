# Ethics, Applications, and Arguments

## The Dilemma

> You're one of the good Christians that doesn't push their views on others.

> I can have my beliefs, and you can have your beliefs.

Listening to statements like these has always amazed me. Christianity states that you're going to hell if you don't believe and practice the same system, and that you should help to save others by sharing your beliefs.

In example 1, this is supposed to be complimenting a person by telling them that they are not doing their job by sharing their beliefs, or that they are a good person for letting you go to hell.

In example 2, this says that your beliefs are fine as long as you don't practice them by sharing them with others.

## Ethics and Applications

There's two parts to most social systems, whether it be government enforced or enforced by societal norms:

1. Ethics and Morals
2. Practices and Systems

When one argues over policies, whether it be abortion, gun control, drugs, etc, it is valuable to separate these two parts because understanding and discussing them involves different approaches.
